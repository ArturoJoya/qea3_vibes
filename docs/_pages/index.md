Have you ever heard an annoying, funky little recurring noise when driving down the highway and simply turned up the radio slightly? Don't disregard that noise! You might accidentally be causing a disservice to the health of your vehicle. A lot of the noises heard are a result of vibrations at different points of a car that are transmitted through the drivetrain, suspention and chassis. These vibrations are always present to some degree, but at certain frequencies get amplified. This would be the part's resonant frequency. We ideally do not want to find the resonant frequencies while in our every day drive, much less hover in them.

Although one could always detect the revolutions per minute (rpm) or speeds at which vibrations feel much stronger, it's not very intuitive to feel out which harmonics are also amplified at those rpm. According to vibration analysts, these harmonics can reveal to us roughly what part of the car is experiencing issues.
